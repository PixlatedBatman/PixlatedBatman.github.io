A Minimal personal website to share blogs and thoughts.

## Instructions for myself because I forget things easily

To locally run the website for testing, run these commands:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```


The website should then be active on [localhost port 4000](http://localhost:4000/) or on [127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000/).
