Hi, I am Karthik Kashyap from EE23B, and here's my blog explaining my experience with Atlassian's Internship selection process as part of IITM's Internship Season 2025.

{: .prompt-warning}
> **Disclaimer:** Due to the privacy statement that I signed while applying to Atlassian, I will not be able to reveal any questions that were asked during this process, be it either OA or the Interview. I will only be talking about the procedure and a few tips to follow in specific for Atlassian and for general Intern process.

The blog contains all the info about the selection process for Atlassian Software Engineer Intern and some tips and guidelines that I found useful during the process.

The selection process had 2 parts: Online Assessment and Interview.

## Online Assessment

The OA consisted of 3 questions based on DSA, and there was 90 min to solve them. The OA was conducted on HackeRank online mode with Video and Tab-switch proctoring.

> **Note:** Atlassian cares about time taken to solve the problems, not just solving them. So your aim should be to solve all the problems and also in as less time as possible. I solved all 3 questions and passed all test cases with 23 min to spare.

The questions were varying from person to person, to prevent chances of copying. The difficulty of the questions ranged from Leetcode Easy to Hard.

## Interview

Atlassian takes 2 rounds of interviews: 1 Coding (Technical) Round and 1 Leadership and Values (HR) Round.

### Coding Round

Lasted for 60 min, the interviewer asked me one question and asked to find the logic and code the problem.

{: .prompt-tip}
> A few important things to note here:
> - Here, finding the logic is the important part. Only after convincing the intervierewer of the logic can you move to coding it. And even in the coding part, it's important to note that they check for clean, modular and streamlined code. Writing comments helps.
> - This problem could have been done with just functions definitions. But writing the Class (including comments) made it so that the object of the class could be conveniently used and made the code much more readable.
> - Do not worry about having wrong attempts. This attempt was my third attempt at a solution. The interviewer wants to see the way you think, so it's completely fine to make mistakes, but be sure to talk your mind out.

### Leadership and Values Round

Lasted for 40 min, the interview gave situation based questions and asked me to provide real life examples that I have encountered in college that best explains this, and explain how I handled it and the outcome of it all.

{: .prompt-tip}
> Though the questions they ask in this round seem to circle about examples you encounter during your projects, it's totally fine to answer questions other than projects, they are totally okay with that. I myself answered 2 out of 3 examples outside of projects, and they were still happy to hear those. They just want to see how well you perform in a group talk, needn't always be a project.

## General Tips

This section is quite long, but please bear with me, I have jotted down some pretty important things that I learnt with my experience during this process, and that you can perhaps do better by knowing it beforehand.

- Software requires DSA knowledge. But most people concentrate on learning the language and getting to know Data Structures. But in my opinion the most important part of DSA is Algorithms. This is what distinguishes you from the others. DS is something you can learn while learning Algorithms.
- Learn not just how Algorithms work, but also WHY they work. Almost never do they ask in OAs or interviews to just code an algorithm. It's always a variation of it. And the only way you can come up with this variation is if you truly know why the Algorithm works.
- Have practice of algoriths. I have seen people watch youtube tutorials like that of [take U forward](https://www.youtube.com/@takeUforward) by Striver (which I absolutely recommend for DSA learning for beginners) and not actually work on solving problems. Trust me, you will not be able to remember the problem a few days later if you havent coded it up and experienced all the bugs and errors that you can get while implementing it.
- Practice of contests on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) gives you a good experience of how an OA will be like. Practice that just before going into OAs. In the case of Aptitude, practice [Brainstellar](https://brainstellar.com/). I am surpised by the amount of overusage of these problems.
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/) is overhyped. Sure, you get to learn new methods and algorithms, but they are too generic, and the OAs will not have as general questions. You need to think a lot to get the logic, and you need to have practice at this, not just implement methods you learnt on LC. With this, I'm not saying Leetcode is useless, I'm only saying that this is not the only thing you need to prepare. Leetcode has such a massive expanse of problems that it's hard to pick which ones are useful and which ones aren't. The [Top Interview 150](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/) problemset on Leetcode is good enough for practice. It has covered several domains of DSA, and is enough for practice. If more practice is needed, you can instead switch over to Codeforces, as that is more oriented towards the OAs than Leetcode.
- Avoid ChatGPT. Just do it. You get work done, I'm not questoning that, but for Intern season, you will not be able to use it in the OAs, so you should be able to solve the problems without it. Some people use GPT for just writing the code when they give the logic, I would suggest against this too, because in the time crunch of the OA, you are expected to find the logic as well as write _bug free code_ which is supposed to pass all the test cases. Without practice of programming, this will not happen magically in the middle of an OA.
- Learn from the algorithms and methods of questions you were not able to solve in a test. The number of repeated questions in the sebsequent tests is surprisingly high (Companies generally choose problems from the HackerRank problem bank or BrainStellar for their OAs rather than make their own). You will feel very guilty for not solving the question you've already seen before.

Lastly I would like to mention that you may not always get the Intern that you wanted. Don't let this depress you in any way, this is just an Intern, not a placement. There's lots of companies, no need to depress yourself over one of them. It will not be the end of the world. I'm saying this because I was of this opinion when it did happen to me in Day 1.1, but now in retrospect I am happier this way that I was able to get Atlassian only because I got rejected by the companies in Day 1.1.

Some companies do not care much about the Test performance or the Interview performance either. Sad to say, but this is how reality is and we need to face it that way.

Thank you for reading so far, I had fun writing this blog. In the end I was happy to get Atlassian, and I hope you too get the company of your wish, and I wish you all the best for it.
