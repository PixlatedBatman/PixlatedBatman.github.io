Hi, I am Karthik Kashyap from EE23B, and here's my blog explaining my experience with Atlassian's Internship selection process as part of IITM's Internship Season 2025.

The blog contains all the info about the selection process for Atlassian Software Engineer Intern and some tips and guidelines that I found useful during the process.

The selection process had 2 parts: Online Assessment and Interview.

## Online Assessment

The OA consisted of 3 questions based on DSA, and there was 90 min to solve them. The OA was conducted on HackeRank online mode with Video proctoring.

> Atlassian cares about time taken to solve the problems, not just solving them. So your aim should be to solve all the problems and also in as less time as possible. I solved all 3 questions and passed all test cases with 23 min to spare.
