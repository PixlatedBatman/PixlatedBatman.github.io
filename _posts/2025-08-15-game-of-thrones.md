Game of Thrones is an amazing series with mind blowing plots and it's unthinkable plot twists. But it also has lots of unexplained stuff, and there's lots of theories out there about some of them. As an avid Game of Thrones fan, it feels dark hearted to not have some of my own. So here I have put forth some of mine.

{: .prompt-warning }
> **Spoiler alert:** This post covers plots of the shows *Game of Thrones*, *House of the Dragon* and even George R. R. Martin's books of *A Song of Ice and Fire* and *Fire and Blood*. Thread carefully if you must.

## Are <span style="color:#E07B48;">Targaryens</span> truly immune to fire?

The name might be slightly misleading, but let's delve into why I think this isnt true:

In Season 1 of Game of Thrones, <span style="color:#E07B48;">Daenerys Targaryen</span> mentions that her brother <span style="color:#E07B48;">Viserys Targaryen</span> was not a real dragon as he got killed by molten gold(burned by fire). This is somehow a misconception by Dany as she seems to be the only <span style="color:#E07B48;">Targaryen</span> to not be burned by fire. Several other <span style="color:#E07B48;">Targaryens</span> (even pure blood) and even other Old Valyrian descendants (eg. <span style="color:#72C2C2;">Laena Velaryon</span>, the only daughter to <span style="color:#72C2C2;">Corlys Velaryon</span>) are shown to been consumed by fire.

It is also to be noted that even *George R. R. Martin's* <span style="color:#E07B48;">Fire and Blood</span>, a book dedicated solely to the <span style="color:#E07B48;">Targaryen</span> rule, has no mention of this immunity of <span style="color:#E07B48;">Targaryens</span> to fire.

What do you think about this? Did Dany just assume that all <span style="color:#E07B48;">Targaryens</span> are immune to fire just because they have the blood of the Dragon, and more importantly is this the case because she was *the prince that was promised*?

## Is George R. R. Martin  really still writing <span style="color:#807875;">The Winds of Winter</span>?

After a disappointing end to Game of Thrones with it's eighth season, fans have been waiting for GRRM to publish The Winds of Winter so see how GRRM actually wanted it to end. Although GRRM's had promised it's release back in 2017, he seemingly hasn't published it even eight years later! Is he really still writing it?

My theory is that he is afraid to release whatever he has written so far. What they have used as the plot in the series might actually be what he wanted to put in the books. Why I say this is because though the end parts of Season 6 and entirety of Season 7 aren't part of the books: The script writers of the approached GRRM about what he wants the story to proceed in the books, and this is what they implemented in the show. This includes the revival of <span style="color:#807875;">Jon Snow</span>, and even the reveal of him being <span style="color:#E07B48;">Rhaegar Targaryen</span> and <span style="color:#807875;">Lyanna Stark's</span> son, <span style="color:#E07B48;">Aegon Targaryen VI</span>. This was not the script writers' idea, GRRM mentioned that this was his idea for the book The Winds of Winter.

This claim can further be proved by the fact that GRRM actually finished writing a physics research paper in the past few years!

## Why was <span style="color:#E07B48;">Daenerys</span> so pretentious?

<span style="color:#E07B48;">Daenerys Targaryen</span> is often seen as quite an arrogant, egoistic and undeniably badass — with a touch of pretentiousness among her many qualities.

Remember in the [S8E1: Winterfell](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Winterfell_(Game_of_Thrones)) of Game of Thrones, when <span style="color:#E07B48;">Daenerys</span> visits <span style="color:#807875;">Winterfell</span>? Since the dragons were struggling to eat properly in the harsh northern cold, she decides to take them on a flight. <span style="color:#E07B48;">Daenerys</span> mounts <span style="color:#6B7280;">Drogon</span> and encourages <span style="color:#807875;">Jon Snow</span> to ride <span style="color:#15803D;">Rhaegal</span>. He is a little hesitant at first because he has never rode a dragon before, but <span style="color:#807875;">Jon</span> eventually takes the plunge and flies a considerable distance.

![Jon Snow riding the Green Dragon Rhaegal](/assets/img/commons/game-of-thrones/jon_riding_rhaegal.png)

Didn't anyone feel suspicious about this? We know from <span style="color:#E07B48;">House of the Dragon</span> and <span style="color:#E07B48;">Fire and Blood</span> that only Old Valyrian descendants like the <span style="color:#E07B48;">Targaryens</span> can ride Dragons as their blood is bound to them through ancient magic. If anyone else tries to ride them, the dragon does not accept them as their rider, be it however hard they tries to favor or ride the dragon. Yet <span style="color:#15803D;">Rhaegal</span> freely allowed <span style="color:#807875;">Jon Snow</span> to ride it without any resistance.

This was a extraordinarily fortunate moment for <span style="color:#807875;">Jon</span>, as the only reason he was able to ride <span style="color:#15803D;">Rhaegal</span>, was that he was, in truth, a <span style="color:#E07B48;">Targaryen</span> — the son of <span style="color:#E07B48;">Rhaegar Targaryen</span>. Without this *crucial detail*, <span style="color:#807875;">Jon Snow</span>, as we know him, would likely have perished that day.

But how could this happen? <span style="color:#807875;">Jon</span> himself cannot be blamed; raised as a <span style="color:#807875;">Stark</span>, he knew little of dragons (~~It's <span style="color:#807875;">Jon Snow</span> after all, he knows nothing~~). But what about <span style="color:#E07B48;">Daenerys</span>? Though dragons had been extinct for generations, as a <span style="color:#E07B48;">Targaryen</span> she should have been aware of this ancient bond. Instead, her pretentiousness nearly cost <span style="color:#807875;">Jon</span> his life.

You might also call this a mistake on the writers since this moment never actually appeared in the books — though you can read more about that [here](#is-george-r-r-martin--really-still-writing-the-winds-of-winter). That said, I won’t claim certainty; it may very well have been an oversight by the writers that created this apparent plot hole.

## Is Daenerys really dead?

Due to a cascade of failures and the loss of her best friend, Daenerys went berserk and burnt King's Landing to the ground. It was quite saddening for us to see Daenerys die at the hand of her beloved Jon Snow for the sake of the wellness of the Realm. Some might find that maddening in fact, that we did not get to see her as the Queen as the 7 Kingdoms.

What people generally don't think about is where Drogon took Daenerys after angrily burning the Iron Throne to a crisp: Did he take her to a cave to spend his days in sadness for the loss of his _mother_?

We know from several mentions within the series Game of Thrones and the books of A Song of Ice and Fire and Fire and Blood that Dragons and Targaryens originally come from [Old Valyria](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Valyria) — a place where lots of magic and spells were used. Of these, blood magic was laboriously practiced. We have seen this from the series too where [Melisandre](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Melisandre) (the red woman) and [Mirri Maz Duur](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Mirri_Maz_Duur) (the witch who cursed Khal Drogo and Daenerys) practiced some types of blood magic.

Though Old Valyria is destroyed, there may be other places where such magic might be legally and extensively practiced.Considering that a magicless land like Westeros itself had a few priestesses who practiced such magic, it would be no surprise if there are other magical places.

And because Dragons are magical themselves and are of Old Valyrian origin, it might be possible for Drogon to know of such places, and could have taken her body there for revival. So actually: Daenerys might be alive. Just that in this new magical place, the Seven Kingdoms wouldn't be as important her, so she might not come back to Westeros.
