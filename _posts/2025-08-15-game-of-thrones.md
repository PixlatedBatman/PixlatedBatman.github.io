Game of Thrones is an amazing series with mind blowing plots and it's unthinkable plot twists. But it also has lots of unexplained stuff, and there's lots of theories out there about some of them. As an avid Game of Thrones fan, it feels dark hearted to not have some of my own. So I have put forth:

## Are <span style="color:#F54242;">Targaryens</span> truly immune to fire?

The name might be slightly misleading, but let's delve into why I think this isnt true:

In Season 1 of Game of Thrones, Daenerys mentions that Viserys was not a real dragon as he got killed by molten gold(burned by fire). This is somehow a misconception by Dany as she seems to be the only Targaryen to not be burned by fire. Several other <span style="color:#F54242;">Targaryens</span> (even pure blood) and other High Valyrian descendants (eg. Laena Velaryon, the only daughter to Corlys Velaryon) are shown to been consumed by fire. 

What do you think about this? Did Dany just assume that all <span style="color:#F54242;">Targaryens</span> are immune to fire just because they have the blood of the Dragon, and more importantly is this the case because she was *the prince that was promised*?

## Is George R. R. Martin really still writing the Winds of Winter?
