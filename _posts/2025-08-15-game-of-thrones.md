Game of Thrones is an amazing series with mind blowing plots and it's unthinkable plot twists. But it also has lots of unexplained stuff, and there's lots of theories out there about some of them. As an avid Game of Thrones fan, it feels dark hearted to not have some of my own. So I have put forth:



## Are <span style="color:#F54242;">Targaryens</span> truly immune to fire?

The name might be slightly misleading, but let's delve into why I think this isnt true:

In Season 1 of Game of Thrones, <span style="color:#F54242;">Daenerys Targaryen</span> mentions that her brother <span style="color:#F54242;">Viserys Targaryen</span> was not a real dragon as he got killed by molten gold(burned by fire). This is somehow a misconception by Dany as she seems to be the only Targaryen to not be burned by fire. Several other <span style="color:#F54242;">Targaryens</span> (even pure blood) and other High Valyrian descendants (eg. Laena Velaryon, the only daughter to Corlys Velaryon) are shown to been consumed by fire. 

It is also to be noted that even George R. R. Martin's Fire and Blood, a book dedicated solely to the Targaryen rule, has no mention of this immunity of Targaryens to fire.

What do you think about this? Did Dany just assume that all <span style="color:#F54242;">Targaryens</span> are immune to fire just because they have the blood of the Dragon, and more importantly is this the case because she was *the prince that was promised*?

## Is George R. R. Martin really still writing The Winds of Winter?

After a disappointing end to Game of Thrones with it's eighth season, fans have been waiting for GRRM to publish The Winds of Winter so see how GRRM actually wanted it to end. Although GRRM's had promised it's release back in 2017, he seemingly hasn't published it even eight years later! Is he really still writing it?

My theory is that he is afraid to release whatever he has written so far. What they have used as the plot in the series might actually be what he wanted to put in the books. Why I say this is because though the end parts of Season 6 and entirety of Season 7 aren't part of the books: The script writers of the show did ask GRRM about what he is going to put in the books, and this is what they implemented. This includes the revival of Jon Snow, and even the reveal of him being Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark's son, Aegon Targaryen. This was not the script writers' idea, GRRM mentioned that this was his idea for the book The Winds of Winter.

This claim can further be proved by the fact that GRRM actually finished writing a physics research paper in the past few years!
