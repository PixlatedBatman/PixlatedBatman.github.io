Game of Thrones is an amazing series with mind blowing plots and it's unthinkable plot twists. But it also has lots of unexplained stuff, and there's lots of theories out there about some of them. As an avid Game of Thrones fan, it feels dark hearted to not have some of my own. So here I have put forth some of mine.

{: .prompt-warning }
> **Spoiler alert:** This post covers plots of the shows *Game of Thrones*, *House of the Dragon* and even George R. R. Martin's books of *A Song of Ice and Fire* and *Fire and Blood*. Thread carefully if you must.

## Are <span style="color:#E07B48;">Targaryens</span> truly immune to fire?

The name might be slightly misleading, but let's delve into why I think this isnt true:

In Season 1 of Game of Thrones, <span style="color:#E07B48;">Daenerys Targaryen</span> mentions that her brother <span style="color:#E07B48;">Viserys Targaryen</span> was not a real dragon as he got killed by molten gold(burned by fire). This is somehow a misconception by Dany as she seems to be the only <span style="color:#E07B48;">Targaryen</span> to not be burned by fire. Several other <span style="color:#E07B48;">Targaryens</span> (even pure blood) and even other High Valyrian descendants (eg. <span style="color:#72C2C2;">Laena Velaryon</span>, the only daughter to <span style="color:#72C2C2;">Corlys Velaryon</span>) are shown to been consumed by fire.

It is also to be noted that even *George R. R. Martin's* <span style="color:#E07B48;">Fire and Blood</span>, a book dedicated solely to the Targaryen rule, has no mention of this immunity of Targaryens to fire.

What do you think about this? Did Dany just assume that all <span style="color:#E07B48;">Targaryens</span> are immune to fire just because they have the blood of the Dragon, and more importantly is this the case because she was *the prince that was promised*?

## Is George R. R. Martin  really still writing <span style="color:#807875;">The Winds of Winter</span>?

After a disappointing end to Game of Thrones with it's eighth season, fans have been waiting for GRRM to publish The Winds of Winter so see how GRRM actually wanted it to end. Although GRRM's had promised it's release back in 2017, he seemingly hasn't published it even eight years later! Is he really still writing it?

My theory is that he is afraid to release whatever he has written so far. What they have used as the plot in the series might actually be what he wanted to put in the books. Why I say this is because though the end parts of Season 6 and entirety of Season 7 aren't part of the books: The script writers of the approached GRRM about what he wants the story to proceed in the books, and this is what they implemented in the show. This includes the revival of <span style="color:#807875;">Jon Snow</span>, and even the reveal of him being <span style="color:#E07B48;">Rhaegar Targaryen</span> and <span style="color:#807875;">Lyanna Stark's</span> son, <span style="color:#E07B48;">Aegon Targaryen VI</span>. This was not the script writers' idea, GRRM mentioned that this was his idea for the book The Winds of Winter.

This claim can further be proved by the fact that GRRM actually finished writing a physics research paper in the past few years!

## Why was Danenerys so pretentious?

Daenerys Targaryen is often seen as quite an arrogant, egoistic undeniably badass — with a touch of pretentiousness among her many qualities.

Remember in the [S8E1: Winterfell](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Winterfell_(Game_of_Thrones)) of Game of Thrones, when Daenerys visits Winterfell, due to the dragons not eating well due to them being in the cold North, they decide to take the Dragons on a flight, where Daenerys mounts Drogon and asks Jon Snow to mount Rhaegal. He is a little hesitant at first because he has never rode a dragon before, but then does ride it a long way.

![Jon Snow riding](/assets/img/commons/game-of-thrones/jon_riding_rhaegal.png)

Did no one feel suspicious about this? We know from House of the Dragon and Fire and Blood that only High Valyrian descendants like Targaryens can ride Dragons because their blood is somehow magically bound to the dragons. If anyone else tries to ride them, the dragon does not accept them as their rider, be it however hard they tries to please or ride the dragon. But Rhaegal freely allowed Jon Snow to ride it.

This was a very lucky moment for him, as the only reason he was able to ride Rhaegal, was that he was a Targaryen himself — the son of Rhaegar Targaryen. If not for this *major incident*, Jon Snow, as we know him, would have died that day. 

But how could this happen? We cannot blame Jon Snow for this, as he was raised as a Stark and wouldnt have known much about dragons (~~It's Jon Snow, he knows nothing~~). But what about Daenerys though dragons were extinct since generations, as a Targaryen, she should have know about this. But her Pretentiousness almost cost Jon his life.

You might also call this a mistake on the writers as this part wasnt actually in the books, but you can read [this](#is-george-r-r-martin--really-still-writing-the-winds-of-winter) for that. But I would also like to mention that I am not firm about this, it might very well be the writers fault for this plot hole.
